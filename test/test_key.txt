THE  WASTE  LAND 

By 

T.  S.  Eliot 

(Winner  of  the  Dial's   1922  Award) 

Burton  Rascoe  in  the  "New  York 
Tribune,"  characterizes  THE  WASTE 
LAND  as,  "A  thing  of  bitterness  and 
beauty,  which  is  a  crystallization  or  a 
synthesis  of  all  the  poems  Mr.  Eliot 
has  hitherto  written."     He  goes  still 
further,  when  he  says,  THE  WASTE 
LAND,  "Is,  perhaps,  the  finest  poem 
of  this  generation;  at  all  events  it  is 
the  most  significant  in  that  it  gives 
voice  to  the  universal  despair  or  resig- 
nation arising  from  the  spiritual  and 
economic  consequences  of  the  war,  the 
cross  purposes  of  modern  civilization, 
the  cul-de-sac  into  which  both  science 
and    philosophy    seem    to    have    got 
themselves  and  the  break-down  of  all 
great   directive   purposes   which   give 
zest  and  joy  to  the  business  of  living. 
It   is   an   erudite   despair:    Mr.   Eliot 
stems  his  poem  from  a  recent  anthro- 
pological study  of  primitive  beliefs,  as 
embodied    in    the    Grail    legend    and 
other  flaming  quests  which  quickened 
men   in   other   times;   he   quotes,   or 
misquotes,  lines  from  the    "Satyricon 
of    Petronius,"  "Tristan  und    Isolde," 
the  sacred  books  of  the  Hindus,  Dante, 
Baudelaire,  Verlaine,  nursery  rhymes, 
the  Old  Testament  and  modern  jazz 
songs.    His  method  is  highly  elliptical, 
based  on  the  curious  formula  of  Tris- 
tan Corbiere,  wherein  reverential  and 
blasphemous  ideas  are  juxtaposed  in 
amazing  antitheses,  and  there  are  min- 
gled all  the  shining  verbal  toys,  im- 
pressions and  catch  lines  of  a  poet  who 
has   read   voraciously   and   who   pos- 
sesses an  insatiable  curiosity  about  life. 
It  is  analysis  and  realism,  psychology 

and  criticism,  anguish,  bitterness  and 

disillusion,    with    passages    of    great 

lyrical  beauty."

THE  WASTE  LAND 


I.    THE   BURIAL  OF  THE   DEAD 

APRIL  is  the  cruellest  month,  breeding 
Lilacs  out  of  the  dead  land,  mixing 
Memory  and  desire,  stirring 
Dull  roots  with  spring  rain. 
Winter  kept  us  warm,  covering 
Earth  in  forgetful  snow,  feeding 
A  little  life  with  dried  tubers. 
Summer    surprised    us,    coming   over    the 

Starnbergersee 
With  a  shower  of  rain;   we  stopped  in  the 

colonnade, 

And  went  on  in  sunlight,   into  the  Hof- 

garten,  10

THE     WASTE     LAND 

And  drank  coffee,  and  talked  for  an  hour. 
Bin  gar  keine  Russin,  stamm'  aus  Litauen, 

echt  deutsch. 
And  when  we  were  children,  staying  at  the 

archduke's, 
My  cousin's,  he  took  me  out  on  a  sled, 
And  I  was  frightened.     He  said,  Marie, 
Marie,  hold  on  tight.    And  down  we  went. 
In  the  mountains,  there  you  feel  free. 
I  read,  much  of  the  night,  and  go  south 

in  the  winter. 

What    are    the    roots    that    clutch,    what 

branches  grow 

Out    of    this    stony    rubbish?       Son    of 

man,  20

THE     BURIAL     OF     THE     DEAD 

You  cannot  say,  or  guess,  for  you  know 

only 
A  heap  of  broken  images,  where  the  sun 

beats, 
And  the  dead  tree  gives  no  shelter,   the 

cricket  no  relief, 
And  the  dry  stone  no  sound  of  water.     Only 
There  is  shadow  under  this  red  rock, 
(Come  in  under  the  shadow  of  this  red 

rock), 
And  I  will  show  you  something  different 

from  either 
Your  shadow  at  morning  striding  behind 

you 
Or  your  shadow  at  evening  rising  to  meet 

you; 


THE     WASTE     LAND 


I    will    show   you    fear    in    a   handful   of 


dust.

"You  gave  me  hyacinths  first  a  year  ago; 

"They  called  me  the  hyacinth  girl." 

—  Yet  when  we  came  back,  late,  from  the 

Hyacinth  garden, 
Your   arms    full,    and    your    hair   wet,    I 

could  not 
Speak,  and  my  eyes  failed,  I  was  neither 
Living  nor  dead,  and  I  knew  nothing,     40 
Looking    into    the    heart    of    light,    the 

silence.

Is    known    to    be    the   wisest    woman    in

With  a  wicked  pack  of  cards.     Here,  said 

she,

Which  I  am  forbidden  to  see.     I  do  not 

find

I  see  crowds  of  people,  walking  round  in

THE     BURIAL     OF     THE     DEAD 

A  crowd  flowed  over  London  Bridge,  so 

many, 
I  had  not  thought  death  had  undone  so 

many. 
Sighs,  short  and  infrequent,  were  exhaled, 
And  each  man  fixed  his  eyes  before  his  feet. 
Flowed  up  the  hill  and  down  King  William 

Street, 
To  where  Saint  Mary  Woolnoth  kept  the 

hours 
With  a  dead  sound  on  the  final  stroke  of 

nine. 
There  I  saw  one  I  knew,  and  stopped  him, 

crying:  "Stetson! 

"You  who  were  with  me  in  the  ships  at

"Oh  keep  the  Dog  far  hence,  that's  friend

II.  A  GAME  OF  CHESS 

THE    Chair   she    sat    in,    like    a    bur- 
nished throne, 
Glowed  on  the  marble,  where  the  glass 
Held    up    by    standards    wrought    with 

fruited  vines 
From    which    a    golden   Cupidon    peeped 

OUt  80 

(Another  hid  his  eyes  behind  his  wing) 

Doubled    the    flames    of    sevenbranched 

candelabra 

Reflecting  light  upon  the  table  as 

The  glitter  of  her  jewels  rose  to  meet  it, 

From  satin  cases  poured  in  rich  profusion; 
li7l 


THE     WASTE     LAND 

In  vials  of  ivory  and  coloured  glass 
Unstoppered,  lurked  her  strange  synthetic 

perfumes, 
Unguent,  powdered,  or  liquid  —  troubled, 

confused 
And  drowned  the  sense  in  odours;    stirred 

by  the  air 
That   freshened   from   the  window,   these 

ascended  90 

In  fattening  the  prolonged  candle-flames, 
Flung  their  smoke  into  the  laquearia, 
Stirring  the  pattern  on  the  coffered  ceiling. 
Huge  sea-wood  fed  with  copper 
Burned  green  and  orange,  framed  by  the 

coloured  stone, 

In  which  sad  light  a  carved  dolphin  swam.

A     GAME     OF     CHESS 

Above  the  antique  mantel  was  displayed 

As  though  a  window  gave  upon  the  sylvan 
scene 

The  change  of  Philomel,  by  the  barbarous 
king 

So  rudely  forced;  yet  there  the  nightin- 
gale IOO 

Filled  all  the  desert  with  inviolable  voice 
And   still   she   cried,   and   still   the  world 

pursues, 
"Jug  Jug"  to  dirty  ears. 
And  other  withered  stumps  of  time 
Were  told  upon  the  walls;   staring  forms 
Leaned   out,    leaning,    hushing   the    room 

enclosed. 

Footsteps  shuffled  on  the  stair.

THE     WASTE     LAND 

Under  the  firelight,  under  the  brush,  her 
hair 

Spread  out  in  fiery  points 

Glowed  into  words,  then  would  be  sav-

Stay  with  me.

Speak. 

"What  are  you  thinking  of?  What  think-

"I  never  know  what  you  are  thinking. 
Think." 

I  think  we  are  in  rats'  alley 

Where  the  dead  men  lost  their  bones.

And  if  it  rains,  a  closed  car  at  four. 
And  we  shall  play  a  game  of  chess, 
Pressing   lidless    eyes    and   waiting   for   a

I  didn't  mince  my  words,  I  said  to  her 
myself,  140 

Hurry  up  please  its  time 

Now  Albert's  coming  back,  make  your- 
self a  bit  smart. 

He'll  want  to  know  what  you  done  with 
that  money  he  gave  you 

To  get  yourself  some  teeth.  He  did,  I  was 
there. 

You  have  them  all  out,  Lil,  and  get  a 
nice  set, 

He  said,  I  swear,  I  can't  bear  to  look  at  you. 

And  no  more  can't  I,  I  said,  and  think  of 
poor  Albert, 

He's   been    in   the    army   four   years,    he 

wants  a  good  time,

And    if   you    dont    give    it    him,    there's 

others  will,  I  said. 
Oh  is  there,  she  said.     Something  o'  that, 

I  said.  iso 

Then  I'll  know  who  to  thank,  she  said, 

and  give  me  a  straight  look. 
Hurry  up  please  its  time 
If  you  dont  like  it  you  can  get  on  with  it, 

I  said, 
Others  can  pick  and  choose  if  you  can't. 
But  if  Albert  makes  off,  it  wont  be  for 

lack  of  telling. 
You  ought  to  be  ashamed,  I  said,  to  look 

so  antique. 

(And  her  only  thirty-one.) 

I  can't  help  it,  she  said,  pulling  a  long  face,

It's  them  pills  I  took,  to  bring  it  off,  she 

said. 
(She's  had  five  already,   and  nearly  died 

of  young  George.)  160 

The  chemist  said  it  would  be  alright,  but 

I've  never  been  the  same. 
You  are  a  proper  fool,  I  said. 
Well,  if  Albert  wont  leave  you  alone,  there 

it  is,  I  said, 
What   you   get   married   for   if  you   dont 

want  children? 
Hurry  up  please  its  time 
Well,  that  Sunday  Albert  was  home,  they 

had  a  hot  gammon, 

And  they  asked  me  in  to  dinner,  to  get

III.  THE   FIRE   SERMON 

THE  river's  tent  is  broken:  the  last 
fingers  of  leaf 

Clutch  and  sink  into  the  wet  bank.  The 
wind 

Crosses  the  brown  land,  unheard.  The 
nymphs  are  departed. 

Sweet  Thames,  run  softly,  till  I  end  my 
song. 

The  river  bears  no  empty  bottles,  sand-

Silk  handkerchiefs,  cardboard  boxes,  cigar-

Or  other  testimony  of  summer  nights. 
The  nymphs  are  departed.

And  their  friends,  the  loitering  heirs  of  city- 
directors  ;  180 

Departed,  have  left  no  addresses. 

By  the  waters  of  Leman  I  sat  down  and 
wept  .  .  . 

Sweet  Thames,  run  softly  till  I  end  my 
song, 

Sweet  Thames,  run  softly,  for  I  speak  not 

loud  or  long. 
But  at  my  back  in  a  cold  blast  I  hear 
The    rattle    of    the    bones,    and    chuckle 

spread  from  ear  to  ear. 

A  rat  crept  softly  through  the  vegetation 
Dragging  its  slimy  belly  on  the  bank 

While  I  was  fishing  in  the  dull  canal

Musing     upon     the     king     my     brother's 

wreck 
And  on  the  king  my  father's  death  before 

him. 
White    bodies    naked    on    the    low    damp 

ground 
And  bones  cast  in  a  little  low  dry  garret, 
Rattled  by  the  rat's  foot  only,  year  to  year. 
But  at  my  back  from  time  to  time  I  hear 
The   sound   of  horns    and    motors,   which 

shall  bring 

Sweeney  to  Mrs.  Porter  in  the  spring. 

O  the  moon  shone  bright  on  Mrs.  Porter 

And  on  her  daughter  200

Followed  by  a  weekend  at  the  Metropole.

Like  a  taxi  throbbing  waiting,

Old  man  with  wrinkled  female  breasts,

At  the  violet  hour,  the  evening  hour  that

breakfast,  lights

Her  stove,  and  lays  out  food  in  tins. 
Out  of  the  window  perilously  spread 
Her  drying  combinations  touched  by  the 

sun's  last  rays, 
On  the  divan  are  piled  (at  night  her  bed) 
Stockings,  slippers,  camisoles,  and  stays. 
I  Tiresias,  old  man  with  wrinkled  dugs 
Perceived  the  scene,  and  foretold  the  rest — 
I  too  awaited  the  expected  guest.  230 

He,  the  young  man  carbuncular,  arrives, 
A  small  house  agent's  clerk,  with  one  bold 

stare, 

One  of  the  low  on  whom  assurance  sits 

As  a  silk  hat  on  a  Bradford  millionaire. 

The  time  is  now  propitious,  as  he  guesses, 

The  meal  is  ended,  she  is  bored  and  tired,

Endeavours  to  engage  her  in  caresses 
Which  still  are  unreproved,  if  undesired. 
Flushed  and  decided,  he  assaults  at  once; 
Exploring  hands  encounter  no  defence;  240 
His  vanity  requires  no  response, 
And  makes  a  welcome  of  indifference. 
(And  I  Tiresias  have  foresuffered  all 
Enacted  on  this  same  divan  or  bed; 
I  who  have  sat  by  Thebes  below  the  wall 
And  walked  among  the  lowest  of  the  dead.) 
Bestows  one  final  patronising  kiss, 
And   gropes   his   way,    finding   the    stairs 
unlit  .  .  . 

She  turns  and  looks  a  moment  in  the  glass, 

Hardly  aware  of  her  departed  lover;       250

Her  brain  allows  one  half-formed  thought 

to  pass: 
"Well  now  that's  done:   and  I'm  glad  it's 

over." 
When  lovely  woman  stoops  to  folly  and 
Paces  about  her  room  again,  alone, 
She  smoothes  her  hair  with  automatic  hand, 
And  puts  a  record  on  the  gramophone. 

"This    music    crept     by    me    upon    the 

waters" 
And  along  the  Strand,  up  Queen  Victoria 

Street.

Beside    a    public    bar    in    Lower   Thames

Inexplicable    splendour    of    Ionian    white

IV.  DEATH   BY  WATER 

|HLEBAS  the  Phoenician,  a  fortnight 

dead, 

Forgot  the  cry  of  gulls,  and  the  deep  sea 

swell 

And  the  profit  and  loss. 

A  current  under  sea 

Picked  his  bones  in  whispers.     As  he  rose 

and  fell 

He  passed  the  stages  of  his  age  and  youth 

Entering  the  whirlpool. 

Gentile  or  Jew 

O  you  who  turn  the  wheel  and  look   to 

windward,  320 

Consider  Phlebas,  who  was  once  handsome 

and  tall  as  you.

V.  WHAT  THE  THUNDER   SAID 

AFTER  the  torchlight  red  on  sweaty 
faces 
After  the  frosty  silence  in  the  gardens 
After  the  agony  in  stony  places 
The  shouting  and  the  crying 
Prison  and  palace  and  reverberation 
Of     thunder     of     spring     over     distant 

mountains 
He  who  was  living  is  now  dead 
We  who  were  living  are  now  dying 
With  a  little  patience  330 

Here  is  no  water  but  only  rock 

Rock  and  no  water  and  the  sandy  road 


WHAT     THE     THUNDER     SAID 

The     road    winding     above     among     the 

mountains 
Which    are    mountains    of    rock    without 

water 
If  there  were  water  we   should  stop  and 

drink 
Amongst    the    rock    one    cannot    stop    or 

think 
Sweat  is  dry  and  feet  are  in  the  sand 
If   there    were    only   water    amongst    the 

rock 
Dead   mount  in   mouth   of  carious   teeth 

that  cannot  spit 
Here  one  can  neither  stand  nor  lie  nor  sit  340 
There   is  not  even   silence   in   the  moun- 
tains 

C4i3 


THE     WASTE     LAND 

But  dry  sterile  thunder  without  rain 
There     is     not     even     solitude     in     the 

mountains 
But  red  sullen  faces  sneer  and  snarl 
From  doors  of  mudcracked  houses 

If  there  were  water 

And  no  rock 

If  there  were  rock 

And  also  water 

And  water 

A  spring  3So 

A  pool  among  the  rock 

If  there  were  the  sound  of  water  only 

Not  the  cicada 

And  dry  grass  singing 

But  sound  of  water  over  a  rock 


WHAT     THE     THUNDER     SAID 

Where   the   hermit-thrush   sings   in   the 

pine  trees 
Drip  drop  drip  drop  drop  drop  drop 
But  there  is  no  water 

Who  is  the  third  who  walks  always  beside 

you? 
When  I  count,  there  are  only  you  and  I 
together  360 

But  when  I  look  ahead  up  the  white  road 
There  is  always  another  one  walking  be- 
side you 
Gliding  wrapt  in  a  brown  mantle,  hooded 
I  do  not  know  whether  a  man  or  a  woman 
—  But  who  is  that  on  the  other  side  of 


you? 


C43  3 


THE     WASTE     LAND 

What  is  that  sound  high  in  the  air 
Murmur  of  maternal  lamentation 
Who  are  those  hooded  hordes  swarming 
Over  endless  plains,  stumbling  in  cracked 

earth 
Ringed  by  the  flat  horizon  only  370 

What  is  the  city  over  the  mountains 
Cracks  and  reforms  and  bursts  in  the  violet 

air 
Falling  towers 

Jerusalem  Athens  Alexandria 

Vienna  London 

Unreal 

A  woman  drew  her  long  black  hair  out 

tight 

IT  44  3 


WHAT     THE     THUNDER     SAID 

And  fiddled  whisper  music  on  those  strings 
And  bats  with  baby  faces  in  the  violet  light 
Whistled,  and  beat  their  wings  380 

And    crawled     head    downward    down    a 

blackened  wall 
And  upside  down  in  air  were  towers 
Tolling   reminiscent   bells,    that   kept   the 

hours 
And  voices  singing  out  of  empty  cisterns 

and  exhausted  wells. 

In  this  decayed  hole  among  the  mountains 
In  the  faint  moonlight,  the  grass  is  singing 
Over  the  tumbled  graves,  about  the  chapel 
There  is  the  empty  chapel,  only  the  wind's 

home. 

C45  3 


THE     WASTE     LAND 

It  has  no  windows,  and  the  door  swings, 

Dry  bones  can  harm  no  one.  39o 

Only  a  cock  stood  on  the  rooftree 

Co  co    rico    co  co    rico 

In   a   flash   of  lightning.     Then  a   damp 

gust 
Bringing  rain 

Ganga  was  sunken,  and  the  limp  leaves 

Waited  for  rain,  while  the  black  clouds 

Gathered  far  distant,  over  Himavant. 

The  jungle  crouched,  humped  in  silence. 

Then  spoke  the  thunder 

Da  400 

Datta:  what  have  we  given? 

My  friend,  blood  shaking  my  heart 

The  awful  daring  of  a  moment's  surrender 
U6  3 


WHAT     THE     THUNDER     SAID 

Which    an    age    of    prudence    can    never 

retract 
By  this,  and  this  only,  we  have  existed 
Which  is  not  to  be  found  in  our  obituaries 
Or  in  memories  draped  by  the  beneficent 

spider 
Or  under  seals  broken  by  the  lean  solicitor 
In  our  empty  rooms 

Da  410 

Dayadhvam:   I  have  heard  the  key 
Turn    in    the    door   once    and   turn   once

We  think  of  the  key,  each  in  his  prison 
Thinking    of   the    key,    each    confirms    a 

prison 

Only  at  nightfall,  aetherial  rumours

The  sea  was  calm,  your  heart  would  have

Gaily,  when  invited,  beating  obedient 
To  controlling  hands 

I  sat  upon  the  shore

Shall  I  at  least  set  my  lands  in  order?

NOTES 


NOTES 

NOT  only  the  title,  but  the  plan  and  a 
good  deal  of  the  incidental  symbolism 
of  the  poem  were  suggested  by  Miss  Jessie  L. 
Weston's  book  on  the  Grail  legend:  From 
Ritual  to  Romance  (Macmillan).  Indeed,  so 
deeply  am  I  indebted,  Miss  Weston's  book  will 
elucidate  the  difficulties  of  the  poem  much 
better  than  my  notes  can  do;  and  I  recom- 
mend it  (apart  from  the  great  interest  of  the 
book  itself)  to  any  who  think  such  elucidation 
of  the  poem  worth  the  trouble.  To  another 
work  of  anthropology  I  am  indebted  in  general, 
one  which  has  influenced  our  generation  pro- 
foundly; I  mean  The  Golden  Bough;  I  have 
used  especially  the  two  volumes  Atthis  Adonis 
Osiris.  Anyone  who  is  acquainted  with  these 
works  will  immediately  recognise  in  the  poem 
certain  references  to  vegetation  ceremonies.

the  traditional  pack,  fits  my  purpose  in  two

with  the  Hanged  God  of  Frazer,  and  because 
I  associate  him  with  the  hooded  figure  in  the 
passage  of  the  disciples  to  Emmaus  in  Part  V. 
The  Phoenician  Sailor  and  the  Merchant 
appear  later;  also  the  "crowds  of  people," 
and  Death  by  Water  is  executed  in  Part  IV. 
The  Man  with  Three  Staves  (an  authentic

218.  Tiresias,  although  a  mere  spectator 
and  not  indeed  a  "character,"  is  yet  the  most 
important  personage  in  the  poem,  uniting 
all  the  rest.  Just  as  the  one-eyed  merchant, 
seller  of  currants,  melts  into  the  Phoenician 
Sailor,  and  the  latter  is  not  wholly  distinct 
from  Ferdinand  Prince  of  Naples,  so  all  the 
women  are  one  woman,  and  the  two  sexes 
meet  in  Tiresias.  What  Tiresias  sees,  in  fact, 
is  the  substance  of  the  poem.  The  whole 
passage  from  Ovid  is  of  great  anthropological 
interest:

V.    WHAT  THE  THUNDER  SAID 

In  the  first  part  of  Part  V  three  themes  are 
employed:  the  journey  to  Emmaus,  the  ap- 
proach to  the  Chapel  Perilous  (see  Miss 
Weston's  book)  and  the  present  decay  of  eastern 
Europe. 

357.  This  is  Turdus  aonalaschkae  pallasii, 
the  hermit-thrush  which  I  have  heard  in 
Quebec  County.  Chapman  says  {Handbook 
of  Birds  of  Eastern  North  America)  "it  is  most 
at  home  in  secluded  woodland  and  thickety 
retreats.  ...  Its  notes  are  not  remarkable 
for  variety  or  volume,  but  in  purity  and  sweet- 
ness of  tone  and  exquisite  modulation  they  are 
unequaled."  Its  "water-dripping  song"  is 
justly  celebrated. 

360.  The  following  lines  were  stimulated  by 
the  account  of  one  of  the  Antarctic  expeditions 
(I  forget  which,  but  I  think  one  of  Shackle- 
ton's)  :  it  was  related  that  the  party  of  ex- 
plorers, at  the  extremity  of  their  strength,

had  the  constant  delusion  that  there  was  one 
more  member  than  could  actually  be  counted. 

366-76.  Cf.  Hermann  Hesse,  Blick  ins  Chaos: 
"Schon  ist  halb  Europa,  schon  ist  zumindest 
der  halbe  Osten  Europas  auf  dem  Wege  zum 
Chaos,  fahrt  betrunken  im  heiligem  Wahn  am 
Abgrund  entlang  und  singt  dazu,  singt  be- 
trunken und  hymnisch  wie  Dmitri  Kara- 
masoff  sang.  Ueber  diese  Lieder  lacht  der 
Burger  beleidigt,  der  Heilige  und  Seher  hort 
sie  mit  Tranen." 

401.  "Datta,  dayadhvam,  damyata"  (Give,

found  in  Deussen's  Sechzig  Upanishads  des

407.    Cf.  Webster,  The  White  Devil,  V.  vi:

Make  a  thin  curtain  for  your  epitaphs."

In  brief,  regarded  as  an  existence  which

T.  S.  Eliot  was  born  in 
1888  in  St.  Louis,  Missouri; 
he  is  a  graduate  of  Harvard 
and  studied  at  the  Sor- 
bonne  and  at  Oxford,  has 
been  a  lecturer,  editor  and 
banker.  For  the  first  few 
years  in  which  his  poems 
appeared  he  was  known 
to  only  a  small  number  of 
readers,  but  his  first  book 
of  poems  and  his  long 
poem,  The  Waste  Land, 
which  has  just  been  pub- 
lished, have  established 
him,  in  the  opinion  of  crit- 
ics, as  without  question  the 
most  significant  of  the 
younger  American  writers. 
Abroad,  and  especially  in 
France,  he  is  held  to  be,  in 
addition,  the  leader  of  the 
strictest  and  most  intelli- 
gent school  of  literary 
criticism.  Only  one  vol- 
ume of  his  critical  work 
has  been  published,  under 
the  title  of  The  Sacred 
Wood.
